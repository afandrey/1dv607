#To run this program:

##Option 1
I have only tried this application on a windows computer.
Using Visual Studio Code and .NET Core.
If user has this the application could easily be used by using the: "dotnet run"
In the terminal.

##Option 2
(This application is only compiled for win10-x64. If it needs to be compiled to anything else please look at: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/luisdem/2017/03/19/net-core-1-1-how-to-publish-a-self-contained-application/)
1. Navigate to the folder: bin
2. Enter the folder: release
3. Open the folder: netcoreapp2.0
4. Choose the folder: win10-x64
5. Look for the file and run: Yahtzee-1dv607.exe

## I did not implement a variant of the game since I thought that was more like what we did in WS3, and since I passed that one I thought it was not necessary.
